#Load and Merge datasets
#1)	Read in the census dataset
readStates<-function(states)
{
states<-states[-1,]
num.row<-nrow(states)
states<-states[-num.row,]
states<-states[,-1:-4]
colnames(states)<-c("stateName", "population","popOver18","percentOver18")
  return(states)
    
}
cleanCensus<-readStates(raw_data)
str(cleanCensus)

#2)	Copy the USArrests dataset into a local variable (similar to HW 2)
arrests<-USArrests
arrests
#3)	Create a merged dataframe -- with the attributes from both dataframes
#get the state names from the USArests dataframe with the rownamesï¼‰ 
#Hint: use the merge command
